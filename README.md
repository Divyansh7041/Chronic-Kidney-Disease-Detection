# Chronic Kidney Disease Detection

A Flask-based web application for detecting Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using machine learning models.
The system is trained on a real-world medical dataset to provide highly accurate predictions, helping in early detection and awareness of CKD.

Overview

Built with Python (Flask framework) for the backend.

Uses Machine Learning (XGBoost & other models) for CKD detection.

Dataset taken from Kaggle (Kidney Disease Dataset).

Achieved an accuracy of 98.33%.

Includes a simple, interactive UI for entering patient health parameters.

‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Python version: 3.8.10
